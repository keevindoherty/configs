# Linux configurations

I've chopped up the distinct installation steps into small bites so that I can pick and choose which ones to run or not. The installation contents are described in the following sections.

## Scripts

- `installEssentials.sh`

- `installUsefulNonessentials.sh`

This script will install nifty nonessential packages, such as:
  - Gnome Tweak Tool. Allows to more granularly configure the OS.

## Manual installations
